                        <p>Getting a detailed report is simple:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Go to the "Stock Analysis" Tab:</strong> This is your main dashboard. It displays a ranked list of the day's top setups.</li>
                            <li><strong>Choose a Stock:</strong> You can either scroll through the ranked list or use the search bar to find a specific company.</li>
                            <li><strong>View the Analysis:</strong> Clicking a stock will instantly load the AI's full report, including its Scrybe Score, trade plan, and data breakdowns.</li>

                        <p>The analysis dashboard contains everything you need to understand the AI's reasoning.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The Scrybe Score:</strong> This is the most important output, ranging from -100 (high-conviction short) to +100 (high-conviction long). The magnitude of the score shows the AI's conviction, and the sign (+/-) shows the direction.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Signal & Confidence:</strong> A simple BUY, SELL, or HOLD signal derived from the score, along with a confidence level (Low to Very High).</li>
                            <li><strong>The Trade Plan:</strong> An actionable plan with specific price levels for Entry, a Target to take profits, and a Stop-Loss to manage risk.</li>
                            <li><strong>DVM Scores:</strong> A quick visual score (out of 100) for the stock's Durability (financial health), Valuation (is it cheap or expensive?), and Momentum (how strong is its current trend?).</li>

                        <p>This is a powerful, curated watchlist of stocks that are currently 'HOLD' signals but are very close to becoming a BUY or SELL. The AI tells you the exact condition it's waiting for (e.g., "Waiting for a stronger trend"), helping you anticipate future trades.</p>

                        <p>This provides the "big picture" view of the market's health. By analyzing key indices like the Nifty 50, the AI understands the overall market "weather," ensuring its signals are aligned with the broader market trend.</p>

                    <Section title="6. Feature Guide: The AI Track Record" id="track-record">
                        <p>A fully transparent performance log of every trade signal the AI has ever closed. You can review the wins, the losses, and the overall historical performance to understand the strategy's effectiveness over time.</p>

                        <p>Our AI is not a magic black box. It follows a disciplined, unemotional strategy based on a weighted scoring system that evaluates three core pillars:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Market & Sector Context (The Weather):</strong> The AI first analyzes the overall market trend. It will not assign a high score to a trade that goes against the market's momentum.</li>
                            <li><strong>Technical Confirmation (The Pulse):</strong> Every potential trade is checked for strong technical data, including a clear trend (ADX) and high trading volume from institutional players (Volume Surge).</li>
                            <li><strong>Risk Management (The Safety Net):</strong> No trade is scored highly unless the potential reward is significantly greater than the potential risk, with risk levels defined by the stock's actual volatility (ATR).</li>
                        </ol>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Use as a Research Tool:</strong> Scrybe AI is a powerful tool to speed up your research and screening process. It is not a replacement for your own due diligence and is not financial advice.</li>
                            <li><strong>Understand the Timeframe:</strong> The VST strategy is designed for a 1-5 day holding period. It is not for long-term investing or intraday scalping.</li>
                            <li><strong>A 'HOLD' is a Valuable Signal:</strong> A 'HOLD' signal, especially one with a low Scrybe Score, is a core part of our capital preservation strategy. It means the AI has analyzed the stock but concluded that the conditions are not optimal for a high-probability trade. It's an instruction to be patient.</li>
