                        <p>The analysis dashboard contains everything you need to understand the AI's reasoning.</p>

                            <li><strong>The Scrybe Score:</strong> This is the most important output. It's a single number from -100 (high-conviction short) to +100 (high-conviction long) that summarizes the quality of the trading setup.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Trade Plan:</strong> An actionable plan with specific price levels for Entry, a Target to take profits, and a Stop-Loss to manage risk.</li>
                            <li><strong>DVM Scores:</strong> A quick visual score (out of 100) for the stock's Durability (financial health), Valuation (is it cheap or expensive?), and Momentum (how strong is its current trend?).</li>
                            <li><strong>Bull vs. Bear Case:</strong> The AI's written arguments for why the stock might go up (Bull Case) or down (Bear Case).</li>

                        <p>Our AI is not a magic black box. It follows a disciplined, unemotional strategy based on three pillars:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Check the Weather:</strong> The AI first analyzes the overall market trend and will not issue signals that go against the market's momentum.</li>
                            <li><strong>Look for a Healthy Pulse:</strong> Every potential trade must be confirmed by strong technical data, including a clear trend and high trading volume from institutional players.</li>
                            <li><strong>Demand a Safety Net:</strong> No trade is signaled unless the potential reward is significantly greater than the potential risk.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Use as a Research Tool:</strong> Scrybe AI is a powerful tool to speed up your research. It is not financial advice and is not a replacement for your own due diligence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Understand the Timeframe:</strong> The VST strategy is designed for a 1-5 day holding period.</li>
                            <li><strong>A 'HOLD' is a Valuable Signal:</strong> A 'HOLD' signal is a core part of our capital preservation strategy. It means the AI has analyzed the stock but concluded that the conditions are not optimal for a high-probability trade.</li>
